            <p>Black's Law Dictionary defines International Trade as the exchange of goods or services between nations. While nations may agree in principle to free trade and market access, considerations like protecting local industry and negating unfair pricing make them resort to trade remedies. WTO compliant trade remedies (such as anti-dumping duties, subsidies and countervailing measures and safeguard duties) are being used by member nations and have far reaching implications for the importer and exporter. </p>

            <p>As WTO agreements have been embraced by almost every nation, complying with their provisions requires a good understanding of GATT and all its covered agreements.
Industries require assistance in initiation of measures to move the concerned government to raise a dispute before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, in order to seek appropriate relief and identification of issues that can be raised before the WTO.
